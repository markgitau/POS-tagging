# Part-of-speech tagging
Using the Hidden Markov Model approach, this program infers the correct part-of-speech label of every word in an input sentence. 
The model is trained by thousands of sentences in the English language, each sentence tagged with the correct parts of speech. 
To calculate the most likely tag for a given word, the program uses the Viterbi algorithm which evaluates the most likely result
given the previous results.
